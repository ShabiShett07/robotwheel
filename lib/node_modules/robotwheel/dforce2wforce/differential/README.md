> Compute the resultant forces of differential wheeled robots given the applied wheel forces.

<section class="usage">

## Usage

```javascript
var differential = require( 'robotwheel/dforce2wforce/differential' );
```

#### differential( wheelbase, f1, f2 )

Computes the resultant forces of differential wheeled robots given the applied wheel forces.

```javascript
var z = differential( 5.0, 5.0, 5.0 );
// z => <Float64Array>[ 10.0, 0.0, 0.0 ]
```

The function has the following parameters:

-  **wheelbase**: distance between the wheels (meters)
-  **f1**: applied force on wheel 1 (Newton)
-  **f2**: applied force on wheel 2 (Newton)

## Examples

```javascript
var discreteUniform = require( '@stdlib/random/base/discrete-uniform' );
var differential = require( 'robotwheel/dforce2wforce/differential' );

var wheelbase = discreteUniform( 1, 10 );
var f1 = discreteUniform( 1, 10 );
var f2 = discreteUniform( 1, 10 );

directional_forces = differential( wheelbase, f1, f2 );
console.log( "Force in the X Direction " + directional_forces[ 0 ] + " Newton" );
console.log( "Force in the Y Direction " + directional_forces[ 1 ] + " Newton" );
console.log( "Angular Momentum in the Z Direction " + directional_forces[ 2 ] + " Nm" );
