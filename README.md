# Robot Wheel Configuration using stdlib

This particular repository focuses on providing the wheeled robot configuration based on simple user inputs and aims to provide a easier and better options for the folks who are working wheeled robots to go with their calculations.

## What is the need of such a repository

- The main motive of this repository is to reduce the burden of manual calculation of robot's parameters by pre-defined functions that can handle the major types of wheeled robots.
- As stdlib is used in this repository, the calculations are highly precise and accurate leading to a high performing robot structure.
- Opening more opportunities for innovation in wheeled robots by reducing the work in the foundational task i.e., calculations.
